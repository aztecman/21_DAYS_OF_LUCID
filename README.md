# 21 Days of Lucid
## https://github.com/tensorflow/lucid
## Day 1: 
**Today's Progress:**
##### 1. Read the articles 'Using Artificial Intelligence to Augment Human Intelligence' and 'Visualizing Representations : Deep Learning and Human Beings' from the recomended readings section of tensorflow/lucid
##### 2. Reviewed the code from the colab notebooks 'Lucid Tutorial' and 'Model Zoo'
##### 3. Messed with some of the code; successfully generated a banner for my next meetup

**Thoughts:**
##### I found the article 'Using Artificial Intelligence to Augment Human Intelligence' very interesting. The authors discuss how learning math and art (and other things) augment our ability to conceptualize and communicate. And so if we learn about Neural Nets, we open our minds to potentially greater depth. My feeling is that certain topics have a richness that allows for this... while others allow for it to a lesser degree. Take for example the 'study' of video-games. A persons mind is probably made much deeper by playing a complex strategy game, than a quick-reaction shooter... however, I would expect some improvements in both gamers cognition. 

**Future Work:**
##### 1. I still need to explore the parameters 'transforms' and 'param_f' in greater detail
##### 2. I'd like to look more into the functions that I copied from the 'Feature Inversion Caricatures' notebook
##### 3. I want to learn to generate perlin noise in numpy

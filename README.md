# 21 Days of Lucid
## https://github.com/tensorflow/lucid
## Day 1: 
**Today's Progress:**
##### 1. Read the articles 'Using Artificial Intelligence to Augment Human Intelligence' and 'Visualizing Representations : Deep Learning and Human Beings' from the recomended readings section of tensorflow/lucid
##### 2. Reviewed the code from the colab notebooks 'Lucid Tutorial' and 'Model Zoo'
##### 3. Messed with some of the code; successfully generated a banner for my next meetup

**Thoughts:**
##### I found the article 'Using Artificial Intelligence to Augment Human Intelligence' very interesting. The authors discuss how learning math and art (and other things) augment our ability to conceptualize and communicate. And so if we learn about Neural Nets, we open our minds to potentially greater depth. My feeling is that certain topics have a richness that allows for this... while others allow for it to a lesser degree. Take for example the 'study' of video-games. A persons mind is probably made much deeper by playing a complex strategy game, than a quick-reaction shooter... however, I would expect some improvements in both gamers cognition. 

**Future Work:**
##### 1. Explore the parameters 'transforms' and 'param_f' in greater detail
##### 2. Look more into the functions that I copied from the 'Feature Inversion Caricatures' notebook
##### 3. Learn to generate perlin noise in numpy (in 1D, 2D, and 3D)
##### 4. Learn to make larger output sizes
##### 5. Learn the interpolation method discussed in the paper 'Differential Image Parameterizations'
##### 6. Bridge my understanding of deep-dream and lucid
##### 7. Reproduce the work of Gene Kogan in lucid (gradient blending, looping animations)
##### 8. Produce a deep-dream zoom animation in lucid
##### 9. Learn the style transfer method discussed in the paper 'Differential Image Parameterizations'
##### 10. Bring the Deep Movie method to lucid
##### 11. Design a short music video (proof of concept: 30 seconds) using feature visualization as a visual effect
##### 12. Learn the 3D method discussed in 'Differential Image Parameterizations'
##### 13. Apply interpolation to a 3D model
##### 14. Explore the work from the research section of tensorflow/lucid
##### 15. Network with the lucid team through slack

## Day 2: 
**Today's Progress:**
##### 1. Read article 'Feature Visualization'
##### 2. Reviewed some colab notebooks: 'Negative Neurons', 'Diversity Visualization', 'Neuron Interactions', and 'Regularizing Visualizations'
##### 3. Found a repo that demonstrates perlin noise in numpy; began documenting the code in detail

**Thoughts:** 
##### I found the task of producing perlin noise surprisingly difficult. The code repo I found today helped tremendously, but I still need to understand certain parts of it better.

**Future Work:**
##### 1. Extend the perlin noise to 3 dimensions
##### 2. Add in non-linear interpolation
##### 3. Tomorrow I will focus on interpolating between feature visualizations
 
**Today's Progress:**
##### 1. Read 'Building Blocks of Interpretability'
